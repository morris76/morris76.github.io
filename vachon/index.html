<p>Todd is a PhD candidate in sociology and longtime advocate for workers’ rights. He has worked previously as a union carpenter and as a public school teacher in New York City before returning to his home state of Connecticut to attend graduate school at UConn. He resides in Colchester with his spouse Genea, and three young children, Marley, Toliver, and Ebba, ages 9, 7, and 5. </p>
               
<p>As a sociologist, Todd’s research interests include social stratification and social movements, with a focus on the labor movement. He has worked as a UConn GA at the Connecticut Labor Education Center where he taught non-credit classes to local labor leaders and union stewards on issues such as collective bargaining, grievance handling, and arbitration. He has also taught several for-credit courses within the UConn sociology department, including Social Problems; Jobs, Work and Globalization; and Race, Class, and Gender.  </p>

<p>Within the GEU-UAW, Todd has played an active role as an organizer since the start of the organizing effort in the Fall of 2013. He worked on collecting signatures for the recognition campaign in the Spring of 2014, lobbied state legislators to support our efforts, and helped organize each of the majority actions taken during negotiations in 2014-2015 to win our first contract. Over the summer, Todd chaired the union bylaws committee which drafted the local bylaws that govern the daily operations of our organization. Todd has also participated in the national Conference of Graduate Employee Unions in each of the past two years, where he has made presentations on democratic bargaining, successful contract campaigns, and new union organizing to members of other GA unions from across North America.</p>

<b>A Strong Union through Participation and Democracy</b>
The culture of our union thus far has been one of active member participation and I will do all that I can to ensure that we stay strong by continuing this tradition. This can be achieved through the formation of an effective steward system; through regular two-way communication between members, stewards, and leaders; and by having numerous opportunities for GEU-UAW members to be involved in decision-making. High levels of member involvement are what allowed us to gain recognition for our union in record time and to make great gains in the negotiation of our first contract. In some regards a union is like a tool with which change can be forged, but it is up to all of us to come together, pitch in and set that tool to work because even the best tools will do little without the human hand to guide them. 
<br><br>
A union of active members that work together to overcome challenges in the workplace necessarily has a more robust democracy than a union in which leaders make decisions in a bubble and paid staffers “service” the contract. Having a highly organized, participatory union will provide greater access to information and opportunities to participate in decision-making, both of which make our collective voice stronger and more representative in our workplace. In short, democracy, participation, and workplace power go hand in hand.
</div>

<div id="contract" style="display: none;">
<h2>Contract Enforcement</h2>
A contract is only as good as its enforcement, which is why I pledge to work diligently with the other members of the executive board, the elected stewards, and each of you to protect our wins every day on the job. Our contract provides us with a clear grievance procedure for challenging contract violations. However, collective action and majority participation are often a faster and more effective means of protecting the rights of GAs. To best protect our contractual gains we will need to keep both sides of the sword sharp and hold the university accountable for any violations of the contract.
