<h2>A Strong Union through Participation and Democracy</h2>
<p>The culture of our union thus far has been one of active member participation and I will do all that I can to ensure that we stay strong by continuing this tradition. This can be achieved through the formation of an effective steward system; through regular two-way communication between members, stewards, and leaders; and by having numerous opportunities for GEU-UAW members to be involved in decision-making. High levels of member involvement are what allowed us to gain recognition for our union in record time and to make great gains in the negotiation of our first contract. In some regards a union is like a tool with which change can be forged, but it is up to all of us to come together, pitch in and set that tool to work because even the best tools will do little without the human hand to guide them. </p>
<p>A union of active members that work together to overcome challenges in the workplace necessarily has a more robust democracy than a union in which leaders make decisions in a bubble and paid staffers "service" the contract. Having a highly organized, participatory union will provide greater access to information and opportunities to participate in decision-making, both of which make our collective voice stronger and more representative in our workplace. In short, democracy, participation, and workplace power go hand in hand.</p></div>
