<h2>Building Community and Solidarity at UConn</h2>
<p>The experience of organizing our union has created a sense of solidarity among GAs from across departments that had not existed before. The experience allowed for us to break out of our individual department bubbles, talk to one another, and become friends with folks from other departments we might have never visited before. To continue the growth of this new-found solidarity and sense of community, I propose that the union should host a series of social gatherings, such as an annual Labor Day BBQ, an All-star softball game, and a regular happy hour or bowling night. These non-work related activities, in addition to participation in workplace actions and regular discussions of workplace issues, can further enhance the quality of life for all graduates.</p>
<p>
Further, our recent contract campaign and significant gains have served as an example for other groups of workers and have inspired many. In addition to building solidarity within our own union, I will actively reach out to leaders and activists within the other unions on campus and build bridges between all workers on campus and in the broader community.</p>
