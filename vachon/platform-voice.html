<h2>A Voice for Graduate Workers in the State political Arena</h2>
<p>As public employees at a public university our work lives are often affected by the decisions of state lawmakers and other elected officials. The nature of this relationship makes politics a necessary part of what we do. Whether it is issues pertaining directly to graduate employees or issues that impact UConn in general, we need to be involved in the legislative process pro-actively and not just reactively (as the university administration has often operated in the past). We can gain a strong voice in the state political arena through our voluntary individual contributions to VCAP and our collective participation in the UAW Community Action Programâ€”a program that directly benefitted us during our union recognition campaign in 2014. Some issues we might consider fighting for include increased funding for the university, expansion of the CT Next Generation fellowship, and continued commitment to making UConn a top research and teaching institution.
