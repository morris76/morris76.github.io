<h2>Preparation for Future Negotiations</h2>
<p>Our current contract expires in 2018, which in graduate school terms may seem distant, but in contract terms is just around the corner. To best prepare for future negotiations we will need to have a good record-keeping system of grievances, a steady stream of communication with all members about which issues are most important to them, and an active organizing drive each semester to inform incoming grads about our past struggles and the need for continued solidarity to remain strong for future negotiations.</p>
<p>Some things we should look forward to fighting for are increased rights and protections for international students who face a unique set of challenges at UConn due to their visa status, lack of outside employment opportunities, and limited access to transportation. We should also fight for expansion of the childcare subsidy for GAs with families and for further reductions in student fees.  </p>
