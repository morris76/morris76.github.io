<h2>Social Justice Unionism</h2>
<p>By coming together and organizing a union, we have gained a degree of power within the university and in society that none of us individually had prior to the formation of our union. With power comes great responsibility. The UAW has a strong tradition of standing with the least well off in our society and fighting for social changes that improve the collective quality of life for all. As a long time social activist, I will continue to fight for social justice as the President of Local 6950. I believe that we, as members of the broader labor movement,  have an obligation to stand up for not just the interests of our members, but to work with other groups on addressing issues that affect all working people and in particular the least well-off or most vulnerable among us. Some ongoing campaigns with which we could find common ground include the anti-sexual assault movement on campus, the fight for 15 movement, and the #blacklivesmatter movement, to name just a few.   </p>
