<h2>Contract Enforcement</h2>
<p>A contract is only as good as its enforcement, which is why I pledge to work diligently with the other members of the executive board, the elected stewards, and each of you to protect our wins every day on the job. Our contract provides us with a clear grievance procedure for challenging contract violations. However, collective action and majority participation are often a faster and more effective means of protecting the rights of GAs. To best protect our contractual gains we will need to keep both sides of the sword sharp and hold the university accountable for any violations of the contract.
